WeSQL-Scale Features Connection Management Read Write Split Read After Write Consistency Load Balancing Getting Started Contributing License Acknowledgements
README.md

LICENSE Language
WeSQL-Scale

wesql-scale is designed to enhance the scalability, performance, security, and resilience of your applications. By managing connections, read-write-split, read-after-write-consistency, load balancing, wesql-scale offers a valuable tool for developers and database administrators.
Features
Connection Management

wesql-scale efficiently manages connections to your database, reducing the overhead on your application and improving performance. wesql-scale relieves you of the worry of the max_connection problem in your database.
Read Write Split

wesql-scale simplify application logic by automatically routing read queries to read-only nodes and write queries to the primary node. This is achieved by parsing and analyzing SQL statements, which ensures efficient use of available resources.
Read After Write Consistency

When an application writes data to the primary node and subsequently reads it on a read-only node, wesql-scale makes sure that the data that was just written to the primary node can be accessed and read from the read-only node.
Load Balancing

The proxy intelligently routes queries to the appropriate read-only nodes using various load balancing policies. This ensures that the workload is evenly distributed across all available nodes, optimizing performance and resource utilization
Getting Started

To get started with wesql-scale, simply clone the repository and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.
